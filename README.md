# gooberts spoopy world
###### it's goobtastic!

a very awesome game featuring hit spur of the moment creature: goobert! everyone
loves the guy, the way he's a goober and all that stuff. he's straight up
goobing it! anyways, this is a very spoopy (not spooky11!!!) game.

## hack club siege
this project was made in a week for the hack club siege week 5, with the theme
"spooky" (eeks!). as of writing i've gotten like 10 hours sunken into the game.
