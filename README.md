# gooberts spoopy world
###### it's goobtastic!

journey into the spoopy world of your good ol' pal goobert. don't worry, it's only spoopy, not
spooky, so it'll be fine. right..?

a very awesome game featuring hit spur of the moment creature: goobert! everyone
loves the guy, the way he's a goober and all that stuff. he's straight up
goobing it! anyways, this is a very spoopy (not spooky11!!!) game.

go through the levels, some of them a randomly generated maze :O, and some of
them special

## hack club siege
this project was made in a week for the hack club siege week 5, with the theme
"spooky" (eeks!). as of writing i've gotten like 30 hours sunken into the game.

## tech stack lololol
godot - game engine at the core of the game (woahhh)  
inkscape - vector graphics editor, used for most things  
aseprite - pixel graphics editor, used for _spooky_ things
